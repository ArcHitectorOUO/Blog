    "bio": "I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, specializing in power systems and automation. I have experience designing energy-efficient electrical networks using AutoCAD and DIALux, building Raspberry Pi sensor control systems, and improving data-processing workflows with MATLAB/Python. I enjoy turning real constraints (safety, reliability, efficiency) into clear engineering solutions, and I’m aiming for roles in power electronics or smart grid technologies.",
    "highlights": [
      "Designed lighting & power distribution networks with AutoCAD + DIALux, improving energy efficiency by ~15%",
      "Built Raspberry Pi multi-sensor control systems with ~95% operational reliability/accuracy",
      "Optimized MATLAB/Python workflows to reduce computation time by ~30%",
      "Hands-on lab experience with wiring systems and low-voltage switchboards (100% safety compliance)"
